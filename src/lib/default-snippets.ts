RIDE ETIQUETTE

Riding in a Pace Line
• Maintain steady, predictable speed
• Don't overlap wheels with rider in front
• Keep 1-2 bike lengths between you and the rider ahead
• Pull through smoothly when it's your turn at front
• Communicate before making any sudden movements

Group Riding Rules
• Ride no more than 2 abreast when traffic allows
• Single up when cars are present or road narrows
• Hold your line and don't swerve
• Point out and call out hazards
• Don't half-wheel (ride slightly ahead of the person beside you)
• Keep conversations for the back of the group

What if I get dropped?
Don't panic! We regroup at designated stops. If you can't keep pace, ride at your own speed and meet us at the next stop. Always carry a phone and route map.


MECHANICAL ISSUES

Flat tire?
Pull off to the side safely and signal to the group. Other riders will stop to help. If you're comfortable fixing it yourself, the group may soft-pedal ahead and wait at the next regroup point.

Other mechanical problems?
Signal the group and pull over safely. Someone will stop to help assess the situation. We don't leave riders behind.


SAFETY FIRST
• Always wear your helmet
• Obey traffic laws (stop signs, red lights, etc.)
• Be visible (use lights in low-light conditions)
• Stay alert and aware of your surroundings
• Communicate constantly
• If you're unsure about something, ask!


PACE GROUPS

Casual (20-23 km/h): Social pace, frequent stops, beginner-friendly
Moderate (24-27 km/h): Steady pace, some paceline work, intermediate riders
Brisk (29-32 km/h): Strong pace, organized paceline, experienced riders
Advanced (34+ km/h): Fast pace, race-like intensity, drop ride

Choose the group that matches your fitness level. It's better to start in a slower group and move up!

Questions? Contact the ride leader before the ride or ask when you arrive. We're here to help you have a safe, enjoyable experience!`,
