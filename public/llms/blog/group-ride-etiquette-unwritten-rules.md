There's an art to riding in a group. Beyond the written rules of the road, there are unwritten codes that make group rides safer and more enjoyable for everyone. Here's your guide to group ride etiquette.

## Arriving at the Ride

**Be punctual.** Aim to arrive 10-15 minutes early. This gives you time to pump tires, use facilities, and socialize before departure.

**Come prepared.** Bring:
- Spare tube and tools
- Full water bottles
- Nutrition for the ride
- Lights (even for daytime rides)
- Cash for café stops

**Check your bike.** A quick ABC check (Air, Brakes, Chain) prevents you from holding up the group.

## Riding in the Pack

### Holding Your Line

Nothing is more dangerous than an unpredictable rider. When in a group:

- Ride in a straight line
- Don't overlap wheels with the rider ahead
- Signal before moving
- Avoid sudden braking

### Drafting Etiquette

When sitting in someone's draft:

- Maintain a steady distance (about half a wheel length)
- Don't stare at their wheel - look ahead
- Take your turn at the front
- Thank the person who's been pulling

### Taking Pulls

When rotating through at the front:

- Pull for a consistent time (30 seconds to 2 minutes)
- Maintain the group's pace - don't surge
- Peel off smoothly and drift to the back
- If you're struggling, say "I'll skip" rather than disrupting rotation

## Communication is Key

### Hand Signals

Learn these essential signals:

- **Pointing down at road** - Hazard (pothole, glass, etc.)
- **Hand behind back, waving** - Move over in that direction
- **Arm out straight** - Turning that direction
- **Arm raised** - Stopping or slowing

### Verbal Calls

Always call out:

- "Car back!" - Vehicle approaching from behind
- "Car up!" - Vehicle approaching from ahead
- "Slowing!" - Before braking
- "Stopping!" - Before a complete stop
- "Clear!" or "Wait!" - At junctions

## The Coffee Stop

The café stop is sacred in cycling culture:

- Don't order until everyone arrives
- Keep orders simple when it's busy
- Offer to help carry drinks
- Be ready to leave when the group is
- Tip well - we want cyclists to be welcome

## Pace and No-Drop Rides

If a ride is advertised as "no-drop":

- Wait for dropped riders at the top of climbs
- Slow the pace if someone is struggling
- Offer encouragement, not advice
- Never attack or race on a social ride

If you're struggling:

- Communicate early - "I'm finding this tough"
- Don't blow up trying to stay on
- There's no shame in turning back early

## After the Ride

- Thank the organizer
- Share photos respectfully
- Provide constructive feedback
- Sign up for the next one!

## The Golden Rule

**Leave no one behind.** A dropped rider is everyone's responsibility. The strongest riders should be looking after the weakest, not attacking off the front.
