Nothing derails a group ride faster than a rider without a spare tube or someone running out of water 30km from home. Here's your complete checklist.

## The Non-Negotiables

These items are mandatory for every group ride:

### Safety Gear
- **Helmet** - Properly fitted, no exceptions
- **Front and rear lights** - Even for daytime rides
- **Reflective elements** - Visible clothing or accessories

### Repair Kit
- **Spare inner tube** - Minimum one, ideally two
- **Tire levers** - For removing stubborn tires
- **Multi-tool** - With hex keys and screwdriver
- **Mini pump or CO2 inflator** - With spare cartridges if using CO2
- **Patch kit** - For that second puncture

### Hydration & Nutrition
- **Full water bottles** - One per hour of riding minimum
- **Energy gels or bars** - One per hour for rides over 90 minutes
- **Emergency cash** - For café stops and emergencies

## Highly Recommended

These make every ride better:

### Comfort Items
- **Chamois cream** - Prevents saddle sores
- **Sunglasses** - Eye protection from sun, wind, and insects
- **Sunscreen** - Applied before you leave
- **Arm/knee warmers** - For variable conditions

### Technology
- **Phone** - Charged, in a waterproof case
- **Cycle computer** - For navigation and stats
- **Emergency contact card** - Laminated, in your pocket

### Clothing Considerations
- **Rain jacket** - Packable, even on sunny days
- **Gloves** - Padded for comfort, grip for control
- **Shoe covers** - For cold or wet conditions

## What to Wear

Dress appropriately for the conditions:

### Temperature Guide
- **Above 20°C** - Short jersey, bib shorts
- **15-20°C** - Add arm warmers, consider knee warmers
- **10-15°C** - Long sleeve jersey or gilet, knee warmers
- **Below 10°C** - Winter jacket, thermal tights, gloves

**Pro tip:** You should feel slightly cold when you start. You'll warm up within 10 minutes.

## Group-Specific Items

For group rides specifically:

- **Matching or club kit** - If you're a member
- **Pocket food to share** - Earns goodwill
- **Knowledge of the route** - Downloaded or memorized

## What NOT to Bring

Some things are better left at home:

- **Earbuds/headphones** - You need to hear traffic and communication
- **Heavy locks** - Only for destination rides
- **Excess gear** - Pack light, ride light
- **Negativity** - Check your mood at the door

## Pre-Ride Checklist

Before every ride, run through the ABC check:

**A - Air**
- Tires properly inflated
- No cuts or wear on tire surface

**B - Brakes**
- Pads have life left
- Brakes engage properly
- Quick releases are closed

**C - Chain**
- Clean and lubricated
- No stiff links
- Cassette and chainrings not worn

## The Night Before

Prepare everything the night before:

1. Check the weather forecast
2. Lay out your kit
3. Charge your lights and computer
4. Fill your bottles (store in fridge overnight)
5. Prepare your nutrition
6. Set multiple alarms
